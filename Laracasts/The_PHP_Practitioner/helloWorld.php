<?php

/**
*	Hello World simple program
*/
echo 'Hello World';

/*
*	Open Terminal or command prompt
*	Go to the location
*	
*	$ php helloWorld.php
*
*	Output: Hello World
*
*	echo means printing - Browser or console/terminal
*	
*	It will work only when we give <?php tag, else it will just throw to output.
*	When we give <?php it will start interpreting
*
*	'Hello World' - it's just a string of characters, we can do in single and double quotes. 
*	There is minor difference between single quotes and double quotes
*	It's not a function/procedure
*
